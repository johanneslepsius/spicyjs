# SpicyJS 🌶️

> Next Gen Developer Experience

- 🌶️ Spice up your coding
- 😎 It's buzzin'

Ever get tired of writing regular, boring JavaScript?
Here's the solution:
Write some spicy JS instead! All the stuff we love about it, but way more fun. 
So far this language works with VSCode - follow the guide below!

Why is it so damn awesome?

Easy - it's modern JavaScript but with the possibility to use the following keywords:

- 'fuckaround...findout' is used just like 'try...catch' and will be transpiled as such, but, well... ✨
- Have you ever felt the urge to 'yeet' an Error instead of throwing it? You've come to the right place 🤩

## Get Started 🦄

- In base folder, run 'npm i -g'
- 'cd ./vscode/spicyjs'
- code --install-extension spicyjs-0.0.1.vsix

Great! Now you're set.

- Create your project and your .sjs file(s)
- Verify that syntax highlighting works. It should look like regular JS, the file should have a 🌶️ icon and the "spicy" keywords should be recognized by VS Code. If not, try again or create an issue!
- Write awesome code
- 'spicyjs path/to/your/sjsfile' This will generate a regular .js file in the same folder as your .sjs file. You can specify the target folder (e.g. ./build or whatevs) as second argument.
